# Custom Taskboard Script

## Description
The purpose of the Custom Taskboard script was to modify existing code to give functionality to barebones foundations. The script utilizes Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap and HTML to allow users to apply 'tasks' with certain due dates.
Comments have been left to show changes done in-detail. By separating each section with comments, it allows the viewer to jump to each section in a streamlined manner. Base code was modified in order to deconstruct and better understand the process of creating functioning functions.
